Here is a Neural Network that I used to classify my own handwriting. I was able to do this by studying Tariq Rashid's book 'Make Your Own Neural Network'. I highly recommend this textbook, as it gives a good basic understanding of the basic mechanics of a Neural Network. I had a lot of fun working on this little project, and I would recommend this book to anyone interested about Neural Networks.
